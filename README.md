# Sentiment Analysis with SimpleRNN

This repository contains code for a simple sentiment analysis model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model utilizes a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN) architecture to classify the sentiment of input text data into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled sentences with corresponding sentiment categories. The dataset is manually curated and includes examples of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NLTK
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

3. Run the `chatbotrnn.py` script to train the model:

   ```bash
   python chatbotrnn.py
   ```

   Enter a sentence when prompted, and the model will predict its sentiment.

## Model Architecture

The sentiment analysis model consists of the following components:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors to capture semantic similarity.
- **SimpleRNN Layer**: Processes input sequences and captures sequential information.
- **Dense Layer**: Performs classification based on the RNN output.

## Performance

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Further experimentation and fine-tuning of hyperparameters may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
